<b>Growth Analysis</b> is one of my R notebooks containing data exploration and statistical analysis for a project analyzing how mouse growth changed over a period of time with respect to mouse genotype, sex, and litter size.  

Please note that the data have been altered, and the results are reported in a vague fashion for the purposes of display in my portfolio, as the data are sensitive and not yet published.{: .notice}
