## Overview
<b>Growth Analysis</b> is one of my R notebooks containing data exploration and statistical analysis for a project analyzing how mouse growth changed over a period of time with respect to mouse genotype, sex, and litter size.

## Background
*Please note that the data have been altered, and the results are reported in a vague fashion for the purposes of display in my portfolio, as the data are sensitive and not yet published.*

The **growth analysis project** has been a large portion of my post-doctoral research at the Lang Lab.  The lab is interested in a number of genes that may play a role in early body development and metabolism.  My role in this project has been to collect mouse growth data (weights in grams, length in milimeters, and body mass index BMI) from genetically modified mice over the course of nine different ages, beginning shortly after birth.  Although the primary factor influencing mouse growth under investigation in this study is the effect of a specific gene, I noticed during my data collection that mouse growth was also impacted by sex (M/F) and litter size (the total number of siblings in a litter).  

This R notebook contains a sample of my data exploration and statistical analysis for this project.  Studies are ongoing to characterize the mechanisms underlying the observed differences in mouse growth, however, these are beyond the scope of this R notebook.
