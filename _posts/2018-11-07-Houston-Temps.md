## Overview
<b>Houston Temperatures</b> is one of my Jupyter notebooks showing a simple visualization of temperature highs and lows from 2005 to 2015 in Houston, TX.

## Background

The **Houston Temperatures** visualization project is part of a Python based Coursera Data Science course I have taken in order to expand my skills with pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. In this assignment, I was given two NOAA datasets for Houston, TX, which came from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily). The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations across the globe.

I found the average maximum and minimum recorded temperatures across weather stations in Houston between 2005 and 2015.  I then found record breaking maximum and minimum temperatures in 2015, which were defined as being 1 and 2 standard deviations above and below average, respectively.
