## Overview
<b>Houston Play Spaces</b> is one of my Jupyter notebooks mapping the free public playspaces for children in Houston, TX: playgrounds, pools, water parks, and skating parks.  Data was gathered from the <a href="https://www.houstontx.gov/parks/"> Houston Parks & Recreation Department </a> website.

## Background

Playing outside, climbing, jumping, swinging and laughing is not only one of the most quintessential childhood activities, it is an indispensable need for children during their development - physically, cognitively and socially. This is especially important today, with children spending less time engaged in outdoor play, and more time glued to screens. In addition, the concomitant rise in childhood obesity and development of near-sightedness along with decreasing time spent playing outside is alarming, but the solution is simple.  

<b>Increase outdoor playtime for children.</b>  

The Houston Texas Parks and Recreation Department has a list of all public Houston playgrounds, pools, water parks, and skating parks with a small description of the kinds of equipment present. I have created a simple interactive map to help parents find these playspaces near them.
