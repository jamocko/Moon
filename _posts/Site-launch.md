We live in an extraordinary time, where almost any answer can be obtained with a few short key strokes into one of the most powerful search engines ever created that curates content from the largest repository of human knowledge ever created.  It is humbling, and I would like to thank everyone who so kindly has contributed their expertise in a variety of domains, such that I may create a functional website in one afternoon, having next to no previous experience building a website, or using GitHub in earnest.

A huge thank you to the creator of this [Moon Jekyll theme](taylantatli.me/Moon)!

My goal, aside from fleshing this website out beyond its current sad skeletal state, is to showcase the data analysis and visualization that I currently have in a number of R notebooks.  [Max Woolf](http://minimaxir.com/) beautifully shares his [R Notebooks](http://minimaxir.com/notebooks/first-comment/) using this platform, and has written a compelling blog post about the [advantages of using R notebooks for data analysis instead of Jupyter notebooks](http://minimaxir.com/2017/06/r-notebooks/).

I will also be sharing my journey as an academic biomedical research scientist transitioning to the adjacent field of data science.  Having begun this journey, and spoken with other academic researchers who have made the switch, I can say that the transition from academic science to data science has quite easy in some regards (working with data and statistics is already second nature), and somewhat challenging in others (learning to use a dazzling array of tools - R, Python, SQL, Git, Hadoop...etc.).  At my current stage of personal training, I would fit perfectly on a data science team that is strong in computer science, but is in need of a statistician and classically trained scientist to help with analytics.  Hopefully in a few more months, I will be more adept at using the tools of the trade, and can be a more versitile addition to a team.
