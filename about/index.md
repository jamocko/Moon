## Professional Summary

I'm a biomedical research scientist turned data scientist. Currently, I am in the final months of my post-doctoral research fellowship in the Lang Lab at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.  For the past 11 years, I have been a data enthusaist: I've been collecting data, wrangling data into a usable format, exploring relationships and visualizing my data, conducting statistical analyses on my data, and finally presenting my findings and interpretations - in peer-reviewed publications, at university seminars, and at international conferences.

### Data Science Career Pivot
Throughout my 11 year career as a vision scientist (**see Background and Research Career below**), I have always loved exploring, analyzing, and interpreting my data, moreso than working at the laboratory bench with animal models of human disease.  Although I have learned a great deal about research and data analysis from my years at the bench, I am looking forward to stepping away from my lab coat and tackling larger, faster, and more complex data sets full-time.  I feel most in my element when I get my hands on a massive set of measures and metrics, and begin exploring and visualizing the patterns that the numbers hold.  Going from numbers to story, and from statistics to insights, has always been my favorite part of science.  My goal is to bring my traditional scientific training and years of experience with messy, real world data to the field of data science.

### Background and Research Career
My love of data began during my sophomore year in college, when I joined the [Fulton Lab](http://www.infantvision.org/alumni--collaborators.html) in the Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology at Children's Hospital Boston. There I began conducting research on a blinding disease that affects prematurely born infants (retinopathy of prematurity).  **As part of my research training, I learned image analysis (MATLAB, Photoshop), electrophysiological signal processing (MATLAB), data analysis and statistics (Excel, SPSS), data visualization (SigmaPlot), and presentation**. My undergraduate work culminated in a [Fight for Sight Summer Student Fellowship](https://www.fightforsight.org/Grants/Awardees/AwardeeProfile/profile/1979/), six co-authored [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=99ESO_8AAAAJ&hl=en ) and five abstracts, three of which I presented at an annual international vision research conference (Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology  - ARVO). 

After graduating from Northeastern University, I moved to Atlanta to pursue my interest in retinal pathology at the Emory Medical School affiliated Atlanta Veteran’s Affairs (VA) Hospital with [Dr. Machelle Pardue](http://www.varrd.emory.edu/people/machelle-pardue/). There, I investigated the effects of subretinally implanted microphotodiode arrays in slowing the progression of retinal degeneration in animal models of retinitis pigmentosa. In my year of working at the VA, **I gave a training seminar at Emory University on signal processing and data analysis of electroretinography (ERG) data**, presented my work at ARVO, and published two manuscripts.  **I developed a set of tools (Excel, MATLAB) for analyzing ERG data that are still in use today**.

In 2010, I joined the Ph.D. program in Physiological Optics and Vision Science at the University of Houston, College of Optometry (UHCO), where I turned my focus again to pediatric blindness (ROP). With my co-advisors Dr. Laura Frishman and Dr. Deborah Otteson, and in collaboration with Dr. Xanthi Couroucli (Baylor College of Medicine), I found that [high doses of vitamin A supplementation protect the developing retina, and reduce the severity of ROP](http://optometrytimes.modernmedicine.com/optometrytimes/news/new-research-and-product-launches-kick-aao-meeting?page=0,9), in a rodent model of the disease. I was awarded grants (UHCO, [NIH](http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/P30-EY007551-02)) and awards ([AOF](https://www.aaopt.org/home/aaof/programs/programs-for-graduate-students/programs-graduates/ezell-fellows-historical-listing)) to fund my research and training.  **As part of my graduate training, I created signal processing and image analysis programs (MATLAB), and received advanced statistical training with biostatistician Dr. Julia Benoit.**

I defended my Ph.D. dissertion in May, 2017 (GPA 4.0), and began my post-doctoral training with [Dr. Richard Lang at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/research/divisions/o/ophthalmology/labs/lang).  At the Lang Lab, I **developed a new statistical method for the measurement and analysis of gene expression data**, and optimized protocols with greater quality control for the collection of data on gene expression to conform to industry standards (MIQE guidelines).  I've also  **automated data analysis and results visualization for the laboratory (Excel), and have begun creating data analysis, visualization and statistical tools for the lab in R.**
